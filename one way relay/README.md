## Introduction
The relay module adopts optocoupler isolation with stable performance, realizing the use of low voltage to control high voltage equipment, small current to control high current equipment, DC to control DC/AC equipment. With the toggle switch, you can choose high or low level trigger mode to make the relay pull action, and with the relay pull indicator light to observe the status of the relay. When the toggle switch is turned to H, the level is high; when the toggle switch is turned to L, the level is low. There is a trigger signal to make the relay pull, at this time to flip the switch back and forth can also realize the manual control of the relay pull.

## Instructions for use
The three pins of relay output have no output voltage, which is equivalent to a single-pole double-throw switch. The switch has no voltage output without the difference between positive and negative poles.
1.Normally open connection
