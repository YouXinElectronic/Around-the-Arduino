START ../src/UnitTest.cpp from Jan 27 2022
Using library version 3.6.0
Ready to receive IR signals of protocols: NEC, Panasonic/Kaseikyo, Denon/Sharp, Sony, RC5, RC6, LG, JVC, Samsung, Whynter, Lego Power Functions, Bosewave , MagiQuest, Universal Distance, Hash at pin 3
Send signal mark duration for 38kHz  is 8 us, pulse correction is 3000 ns, total period is 26 us
5000 us is the (minimum) gap, after which the start of a new IR packet is assumed
10 us are subtracted from all marks and added to all spaces for decoding
