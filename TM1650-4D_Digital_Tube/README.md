## Introduction
The module consists of a 12-pin 0.36-inch red co-negative digital tube and a TM1650 driver chip, which greatly reduces the drive pins and wires, and only requires four lead IIC to control the display of the digital tube. TM1650 is a special circuit for LED (light emitting diode display) driver control with keyboard scanning interface. Internal integrated MCU input and output control digital interface, data latch, LED driver, keyboard scanning, brightness adjustment and other circuits.

## Parameter
Pin interface: 4-wire PH2.0 socket 
V (5V), G (GND), D (SDA data pin of IIC interface), C (SCL clock pin of IIC interface)

Provides 8 level brightness control

The segment drive current is greater than 25mA, and the bit drive current is greater than 150mA

Mounting hole size: 3mm
