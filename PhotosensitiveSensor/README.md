## Introduction
Photosensitive resistors are special resistors made of semiconductor materials such as sulfide or selenide barriers, and their working principle is based on the internal photoelectric effect. With the increase of the light intensity, the resistance value decreases rapidly. Because the carriers generated by the light are involved in conducting electricity, they drift under the action of the applied electric field, and the electrons rush to the positive terminal of the power supply and the holes rush to the negative terminal of the power supply, so that the resistance value of the photoresistor decreases rapidly. In the absence of light, almost high resistance state, dark resistance is very large.

Photosensitive resistance module is generally used to detect the brightness of ambient light, trigger the MCU or relay module, etc. Use wide voltage LM393 comparator, signal clean, good waveform, strong driving capacity, more than 15mA. Equipped with adjustable potentiometer can adjust the detection of light brightness. Fixed bolt hole M3 for easy installation.

## Instructions for use
Digital quantity D output can directly drive the store relay module, which can form a light control switch. Analog A can be connected to AD module, and the value of ambient light intensity can be obtained through AD conversion. When the ambient light brightness does not reach the set threshold, the D end outputs a high level; when the ambient light brightness exceeds the set threshold, the D end outputs a low level. Detection brightness can be adjusted by potentiometer, clockwise potentiometer, detection brightness increase; Counterclockwise potentiometer to detect luminance reduction.
