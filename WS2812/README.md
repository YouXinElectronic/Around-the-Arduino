## Introduction
WS2812 digital RGB full color LED module is a cascaded RGB full color single bead module. Different from the traditional RGB full-color light beads, which require three control signal lines and occupy many resources, the control module only needs one signal line. There is no need for cutting and welding, so that the length of the lamp string is more simple and flexible, and more suitable for the on-site production and construction of the project. Fully compatible with the driver circuit or program used by the light belt, so that users can seamlessly convert between the light belt and the module cascaded light string, without any change to the existing project program, running lights, flashing, rainbow transformation, even text, letters, pictures, animation and other cool effects seamless conversion.
